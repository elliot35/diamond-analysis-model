# Diamond Classification using Deep Learning

This project implements a deep learning solution for automatically identifying diamond characteristics from images, including shape, carat, color, clarity, cut, polish, symmetry, fluorescence, and culet. The system uses PyTorch for the machine learning implementation and is deployed on AWS with Terraform for infrastructure management.

## Project Overview

The system consists of:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning pipeline
- CNN-based deep learning model using PyTorch
- Dynamic learning capabilities for continuous model improvement
- AWS deployment infrastructure using Terraform
- API endpoints for real-time diamond classification

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch
- AWS Account
- Terraform
- Docker
